{"name":"Err","body":"err - the pluggable jabber bot\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nerr is a plugin based XMPP chatbot designed to be easily deployable, extensible and maintainable.\r\nIt is written in python and it is based on jabberbot_ and yapsy_ with some minor modifications for the first one.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrief History\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nAt Mondial Telecom (http://www.mondialtelecom.eu), we needed a chat bot over XMPP so it can reach the non techie audience of the company.\r\nWe started to write so much features that we decided to make a more modular bot framework.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n- Tested with hipchat_ and openfire_ but should be compatible with any XMPP/Jabber servers.\r\n- Can be setup so a restricted list of persons have the administration rights\r\n- Dynamic plugin architecture : the bot admin can install/uninstall/enable/disable plugins dynamically just by chatting with the bot.\r\n- Supports MUCs (chatrooms)\r\n- Can proxy and route one 2 one messages to MUC so it can enabler simpler XMPP notifiers to be MUC compatible (for example the jira XMPP notifier).\r\n- Really easily extensible (see example below)\r\n- Provides an an automatic persistance store per plugin\r\n- an !help command that generate dynamically the documentation from the python docstrings of the commands\r\n\r\n.. _hipchat: http://www.hipchat.org/\r\n.. _openfire: http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/\r\n.. _jabberbot: http://thp.io/2007/python-jabberbot/\r\n.. _yapsy: http://yapsy.sourceforge.net/\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\nCreate a user for the bot on your private XMPP server or a public server like jabber.org.\r\nOptionally you can create a MUC (also called conference room or chatroom) in which you can interact with the bot. \r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation from the sources\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**\r\n\r\nPython 2.7+ but probably not 3.0\r\nAnd those python modules. The copy-paste for the lazy pip users but if you can have them from your standard distro it is better\r\n::\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nCreate a user for the bot in your XMPP server admin.\r\n\r\nFrom the installation directory copy\r\n::\r\n    cp errbot/config-template.py config.py\r\n\r\nRead the inline documentation of the file and edit the values so the bot can connect to your XMPP server\r\n\r\n**Starting the daemon**\r\n\r\nFor a one shot try, I would recommend to use\r\n::\r\n    ./scripts/err.py\r\n\r\nso you can inspect the logs for an immediate feedback\r\n\r\nThen at deployment time, a nohup utility script can be used\r\n::\r\n    ./scripts/err.sh\r\n\r\nNote that config.py needs to be at the root of the working directory of the bot.\r\n\r\nMore details on the bot admin features can be found on the wiki : https://github.com/gbin/err/wiki/admin\r\n\r\nInstallation from pypi\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nPip will take care of installing err and the basic dependencies for you\r\n::\r\n    pip install err\r\n\r\nGo to or create a working directory for it then copy there and adapt the configuration template\r\n::\r\n    cp /usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/errbot/config-template.py config.py\r\n\r\nThen you can start and try your bot\r\n::\r\n    err.py\r\n\r\n\r\nInteract with the Bot\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Invite the bot directly from your chat client.\r\n- Send \"!help\" to it without the quotes\r\n- it should answer by the list of available commands and a short explanation\r\n- if you want to know more about a command you can do \"!help command\"\r\n\r\nMore documentation is available on the wiki : https://github.com/gbin/err/wiki\r\n\r\nInstall/uninstall a public known plugin\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo get a list of public repo you can do\r\n::\r\n    !repos\r\n\r\nThen pick one that you fancy for example\r\n::\r\n    !install err-pollbot\r\n\r\nYou should have instantly a new poll service you can use to vote for where to lunch with you collegues :)\r\n\r\nYou can imply uninstall a plugin by its name:\r\n!uninstall err-pollbot\r\n\r\nNote: Please pay attention when you install a plugin, it may require more python external dependencies.\r\n\r\nTutorial to write a simple plugin\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nTry it ! It is super simple !\r\n\r\nYou can find a tutorial here : https://github.com/gbin/err/wiki/plugin-dev\r\n\r\n","tagline":"err is a plugin based XMPP chatbot designed to be easily deployable, extensible and maintainable.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
